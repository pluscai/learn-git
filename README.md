# 2.Git Basics
## 2.2 Recording Changes to the Repository
### Committing Your Changes
> Remember that the commit records the snapshot you set up in your staging area.  Anything you didnâ€™t stage is still sitting there modified; you can do another commit to add it to your history.

### Skipping the Staging Area
```
git commit -a -m"" => git add All  +  git commit -m""
```

### Removing Files

- `git rm` : The `git rm` command does that, and also removes the file from your working directory
- `git rm --cached xx`:   keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore
